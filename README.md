# Behind Every Record A Life Is Lost!

US Homicide Data Analysis (1980–2014)

## Overview
This project explores patterns and insights in homicide data across the United States over a 35-year period. The dataset includes detailed information about victims, offenders, relationships, weapons used, and resolution status of the crimes. The goal is to understand how demographics, geography, and interpersonal relationships affect violent crime trends.

## Project Objectives
- Identify the most violent states over time.
- Analyze victim-offender relationships.
- Understand demographic patterns among victims and perpetrators (age, sex, race).
- Determine the most commonly used weapons and where they're used.
- Compare solved vs. unsolved cases and identify influencing factors.

## Data Source
- Dataset Name: `US_Crime_DataSet`
- Records: 638,454

- Source: FBI and U.S. Law Enforcement Agencies

## Key Features
- Victim and perpetrator details: age, gender, race
- Type of crime (Homicide vs. Negligence)
- Crime location (State)
- Case status (Solved/Unsolved)
- Relationship between victim and offender
- Weapon used

## Tools Used
- Power BI for interactive visualizations and dashboards
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for cleaning and preliminary analysis
- Microsoft PowerPoint for final presentation design

## Limitations
- Some missing values for perpetrator characteristics and relationships
- No data on motive or mental health
- State population not included — no per capita comparison
- Inconsistent labeling in categories (e.g., weapon names)

## Recommendations
- Improve consistency in data reporting across agencies
- Increase investment in case resolution (especially unsolved ones)
- Strengthen domestic violence prevention programs
- Reevaluate weapon accessibility policies
- Tailor state-specific strategies for high-crime regions
